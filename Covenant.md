### Background

This covenant was created after a huge fiasco happened when I was invited as a Speaker to a renowned university. In light of those bad experiences, I have decided to make this covenant which would ensure the comfort of the speaker at the venue while not allowing him/her to allegedly 'boss' over the inviting university.

#### Section-I Travel

1.1)













#### Section-II- Accomodation

2.1) An accomodation must be provided to the speaker regardless of his city/country of origin. In case, the speaker refuses accomodation due to any unspecified reason, the university should still book a room for emergency purposes.
2.2) If the university city does not have a proper lodging area, the university should house the speaker in it's guesthouse. The speaker has the right to know his\her lodgings before agreeing to deliver a talk at the university.
2.3) The accomodation should be hygienic and well-cleaned. In case, the speaker feels the accomodation is not clean upto health standards, he/she has the right to be allocated another room or another hotel.
2.4) The university has an equal right in choosing a suitable lodging premise. It also should inform it's accomodation allowance while inviting the speaker. 
2.5) After a speaker arrives at the city of the lecture, he/she does not have the right to recommend hotels/motels of his/her choice to the universities. The speaker is requested not to demand splurge hotels for accomodation.
2.6) The speaker is responsible for his/her belongings in the lodging location. The university holds no responsibility for the theft of belongings outside the campus.
2.7) The university should ensure that regular cleaning services take place during the speaker's stay. 
2.8) The speaker has the right to be provided accomodation from 2 days prior to the lecture to 2 days post-lecture. In case of an unexpected delay; flights being cancelled for example, the speaker has the right to be allocated accomodation for 5 more days.
2.9) The speaker has the right to be allocated another room or another hotel within any part of his/her duration of stay.
2.10) In all the above rights, the university is represented by the person communicating with the speaker on behalf of the university. 
2.11) In case of violation of any of these points by the university, the speaker has the full right to refuse giving the lecture or talk he/she has been invited for.
